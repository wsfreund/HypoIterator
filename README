To compile do on root:
.x execGenData.C
To load do on root:
.x loadGenData.C 
To run use genCompData:
if you just want to read a NTuple generated by Athena and write the analysis NTuple do:
genCompData("path-to-Ntuple-to be-Read","path-to-Ntuple-to-be-wrote"); 
if you want to read a NTuple write the analysis NTuple and write the rings into a Matlab file do:
genCompData("path-to-Ntuple-to be-Read","path-to-Ntuple-to-be-wrote","matlabFile.m"); 
DONT FORGET THE .m
